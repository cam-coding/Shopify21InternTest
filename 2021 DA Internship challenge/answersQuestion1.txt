Question 1:Â Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following:(dataset also in this folder)
On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. 
We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, 
we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, 
a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 
    1. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
    2. What metric would you report for this dataset?
    3. What is its value?
	
1. Okay first thing that jumped out is the Giant 704,000 order value. Also the order is for 2000 shoes to that's wack.
Filtering on shop_id I see that shop sells 1 shoe for 352 so it's not just bad data. But 2000 shoes is a crazy outlier.
Totalling the order amount and dividing by the # orders I get the same AOV of $3145.13. 

2. So I think I could choose a simple or complex option. Either go simple and just take the mode of the data, or 
work on removing the outliers and take the average again.

3. Using an excel function I find the mode is 153.

Looking to remove the outliers I think i'll play with the data of two stores. First is shop_id 42. So they sell shoes for $352
and have some customers buying a couple. So that's fine i'll leave that. But i'll remove the orders of 2000 shoes. Firstly
no human buys shoes 2000 at a time. Secondly they always happen at 4am with some at the exact same time and
the same user_id, so that's pretty fishy.

After that our AOV is 754.09 so that still seems high. 

Next is shop_id 78. So uh, their shoes sell for $25,725 which is pretty wack. Although the purchases seem to come from
real people at random times, it throws our numbers way out so i'm going to be cleaning this as well. After removing those
purchases as well I end up with an AOV of 299.79.

Also I was curious so I found the price each company sold their shoe for. The average price is $152 for a pair of sneakers
from the average shop in our list. Also the Average purchase is for 1.9947 shoes so that lines up pretty closely with my
AOV of $299.79.
