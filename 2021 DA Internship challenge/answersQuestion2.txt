YIKES this query is bad. But there seems to be something wrong with the DB/w3schools.
No Full joins or multiple joins execute when using this DB. At first I thought I was crazy
but then I tried w3schools own examples and those also resulted in errors. So now I have this
gross double nested query :D

SELECT b.ProductID, totalSales, ProductName
FROM
(
  SELECT ProductID, SUM(Quantity) AS totalSales
  FROM
  (
    SELECT *
    FROM Orders AS o
        INNER JOIN 
        Customers AS c
        ON o.CustomerID=c.CustomerID
    WHERE Country='Germany'
  ) a
  INNER JOIN
  OrderDetails AS od
  ON a.OrderID=od.OrderID
  GROUP BY ProductID
) b
INNER JOIN 
Products AS p
ON b.ProductID=p.ProductID
ORDER BY totalSales DESC
